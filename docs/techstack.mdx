# Tech Stack

Anaya Tech Stack comprises several tools for various purposes:

1. [**Unstructure**](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured): This tool is used to extract text, images, and tables from PDF documents.

2. [**Ollama**](https://github.com/ollama/ollama): Ollama serves multiple functions, including generating summaries and embeddings of extracted data offline to maintain data privacy. It also acts as an intermediary between the user and LocalGPT, translating natural language questions into queries for the model and displaying the answers generated by LocalGPT in a readable format. Ollama also supports embedding models, making it possible to build retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications that combine text prompts with existing documents or other data.

3. [**Chroma**](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma): This tool is used to save the embeddings in a vector database.

4. [**LangChain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): LangChain is used to create a content engine that connects everything together for the best generation.

5. [**Streamlit**](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit): This tool is used to create a user interface so that users can interact with the LangChain content engine.
